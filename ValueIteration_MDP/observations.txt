TASK 3
-----------------
1) regarding 'path.png'
	Here the path is longer than the optimal path from start to end.
	As the probability p = 0.2 is very small (near to 0) which results in high information loss(1-p), thus allowing the agent recieving the correct action only with probability 0.2 and leading to a valid random move with high probability 0.8, Hence the no of steps taken are more than that of optimal path which is depicted in the graph.

2) regarding 'plot.png'
	As the probaility increases from 0 to 1, at a given state the probaility of choosing the optimal action increases leading to less no steps required to reach to the end.This is depicted well in th graph.
	In the graph as the p increases from 0 to 1 the no of actions to reach to the end state continuously decreases.
	At p = 0, no of steps required are very much greater than that of optimal value because there is no advantage of finding the optimal action at a state here as all the actions corresponds to same probability.
